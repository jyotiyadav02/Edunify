## 📝 Features

- **Add School:** Easily add new schools to the database.
- **Show Schools:** View a list of all the schools with their details.

## 💡 Motivation

I created this project to enhance my skills in Next.js, React, and web development. The goal is to provide a straightforward interface for managing school data and to create a meaningful and practical application.

## 🌐 API Routes

This project includes API routes to handle data operations:

- **Add School:** `/api/addSchool`
- **Get Schools:** `/api/getSchools`

These routes can be accessed and modified in the `src/app/pages/api` directory.
